# Utilities folder

The utilities/ folder gathers all the utility classes used in the project.

The rule of thumb for this folder is that each class should be responsible for one thing- Spacing, setting something to a certain colour etc.

- _spacing.scss
- _containers.scss
- _background-colours.scss

For a small project, a single unified file might be enough but there is harm in splitting them up into smaller ones.

- _utilities.scss
<!-- Spacing, Containers, setting background colours -->
